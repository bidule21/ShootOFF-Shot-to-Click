# ShootOFF-Shot-to-Click

A training exercise for ShootOFF that converts a shot on the arena to a mouse click on the screen the arena was calibrated on.

This exercise allows you to play click-based flash games (e.g. http://www.flash-game.net/game/994/virtual-cop.html) with ShootOFF. Simply place the game you want to play on the projector, start ShootOFF, enable the arena and wait for it calibrate, turn on Shot to Click, bring the window with the game back up using alt-tab, and start playing! 

This exercise DOES NOT work with DirectX games, which require much more effort to simulate clicks.
